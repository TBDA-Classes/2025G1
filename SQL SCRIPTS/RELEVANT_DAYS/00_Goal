# Relevant Days Selection

## 🎯 Objective
Identify 10 representative machine activity days across the entire dataset.

These days will be used for focused analysis and testing of the WORKING/IDLE detection pipeline, ensuring that all activity levels are covered (from low to high).

## 📂 Folder content
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `01_daily_distribution.sql` | Counts total logs per day and builds an activity histogram |
| `02_select_representative_days.sql` | Selects one day per decile of activity (based on total log counts) |
| `03_check_selected_days.sql` | Validates the selected days and displays their counts |

---

## 🧠 Method overview
1. Compute daily totals of logs from `variable_log_float` + `variable_log_string`.
2. Rank days by activity level (using `NTILE(10)` to create 10 deciles).
3. Select one day per decile (the one closest to the median of that group).
4. Use those 10 days for further analysis or visualization.

## 📊 Expected Output
| decile | day | total_logs |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| 1 | 2020-12-31 | 2 300 logs |
| 2 | 2021-01-18 | 40 000 logs |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | 2021-03-07 | 1 890 000 logs |

## ✅ Final goal
A list of **10 representative days**, covering all activity levels in the dataset.
