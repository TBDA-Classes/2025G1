1. Project Overview

Project Name: Understanding from Numerical Control Driven machine

Business Case: To analyze information collected by the numerical control and stored in high frequency to bring human-understandable hints.

Objective: Develop a user-friendly system that processes data, track energy use and generate alerts. 

2. Scope

In Scope : 
•	Data collection and structuring from the Numerical Control Driven machine system.
•	Analysis of the operational periods, sequences and energy metrics. 
•	Development of an interface for data visualization.
•	Detection of anomalies and contextual alerts.
•	Documentation of methodology and algorithms.
Out of Scope :
•	Direct machine control or hardware modifications.
•	Integration into existing industrial control systems.
•	Predictive maintenance application.

3. Success Criteria
•	User-friendly visualization of results through the interface
•	Data processing
•	Provide alerts
•	Accurate estimation of energy demand per program
•	Documentation

4. Key Needs / Requirements
•	Identify operation periods and working segments.
•	Create a UI for easy interaction.
•	Detect repeated operation sequences.
•	Determine timing and energy demands per program.
•	Identify relevant variables affected by operations.
•	Determine alerts and contextualize them.
•	Document the approach and algorithms.
•	Access to data (PostgreSQL connection).

5. Constraints
•	Time/planning
•	Limited data processing capacity (high frequency)
•	Data quality: large dataset may contain missing or noisy values

6. Assumptions
•	All necessary data is provided
•	The provided data is accurate and reliable
•	The data comes from the same machine 
•	Energy demand can be estimated from available variables without installing new sensors

7. Stakeholders
•	Product Owner: Joaquin Ordieres  
•	Users: factory operators / supervisors / maintenance team / data analysts
•	Developers: 
    - UI/UX : Sandini, Lorenzo, Tim

8. Timeline / Milestones
•	Sprint 1: 29/09/2025 – 12/10/2025 – Identify the relevant data from the database to have a clear dataset ready for use and analysis.
•	Sprint 2: 13/10/2025 – 26/10/2025
•	Sprint 3: 27/10/2025 – 09/11/2025
•	Sprint 4: 10/11/2025 – 23/11/2025
•	Sprint 5: 24/11/2025 – 07/12/2025
•	Sprint 6: 08/12/2025 – 22/12/2025
